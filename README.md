## Tool documentations

**When the docs pages are built, documentation of the following repositories will be pulled in from the respective repos and updated automatically:**

- [lsp-factory.js](https://github.com/lukso-network/tools-lsp-factory/tree/develop/docs)
- [erc725.js](https://github.com/ERC725Alliance/erc725.js/tree/develop/docs)

**NOTE:**
Make sure to edit these tools in their respective repos, otherwise changes in the docs here will be overwritten.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
